# Libris — Progress log

Append-only. Newest entry last. One entry per loop iteration (or per human
session that changed something a future run must know).

An entry is the story of one task in about twenty-five lines, never more
than forty. It repeats nothing the pull request holds: what was built and
how it was verified are its body, and the diff is the diff. A fact a future
run must know goes in `agent/gotchas/`, not here. The entries of a
finished phase move to `agent/archive/`, one file per phase.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — T### short title — status
- Did: what exists now that did not, in three lines at most
- Decided: one item per choice the brief left open, what and why (or "nothing")
- Deviations from the brief: what and why (or "none")
- Left over: what the task leaves to another, and where it is written (or "nothing")
```

## 2026-10-07 — Catalogue and covers done, with Tophe
- Did: Tophe checked the *Done* of `specs/catalogue.md` and `specs/covers.md`
  on the Pixel; both specs read done 2026-10-07, and the catalogue, web
  layer and covers sections of `agent/TASKS.md` are one line each under
  *Done*. Their entries moved to `agent/archive/progress-catalogue.md` (T042
  to T050) and `agent/archive/progress-covers.md` (T051 to T071, T068 and
  the sessions with Tophe between them).
- Decided: nothing.
- Deviations from the brief: none; no brief.
- Left over: the backlog is empty; the next feature waits for its spec,
  written with Tophe.

## 2026-10-14 — Bookshelves and the order on the screen done, with Tophe
- Did: Tophe checked the *Done* of `specs/bookshelves.md` on the Pixel on
  staging, the second account reached on a second port of the staging
  proxy. The spec is done; the Order on the screen (T086–T087) and
  Bookshelves (T072–T090) sections of `agent/TASKS.md` are one line each
  under *Done*, and the staging question left with D09's staging bullet.
- Decided: their entries moved to `agent/archive/progress-order.md` and
  `agent/archive/progress-bookshelves.md`, as the phases before them did.
- Left over: the backlog is empty; the next feature needs its spec,
  written with Tophe.

## 2026-10-16 — Series list done, with Tophe
- Did: Tophe checked the *Done* of `specs/series-list.md` on the Pixel on
  staging. The spec is done; the Series list section (T092–T099) of
  `agent/TASKS.md` is one line under *Done*.
- Decided: its entries moved to `agent/archive/progress-series-list.md`, as
  the phases before it did.
- Left over: the backlog is empty; the next feature, the series page, needs
  its spec, written with Tophe.

## 2026-10-16 — Icons done, with Tophe
- Did: Tophe checked the *Done* of T100 on the Pixel on staging. The Icons
  section (T100) of `agent/TASKS.md` is one line under *Done*.
- Decided: its entry moved to `agent/archive/progress-icons.md`, as the
  phases before it did; U07's wording, "the stand-in of a row's missing
  cover", landed with T100's pull request on Tophe's go.
- Left over: the backlog is empty; the next feature, the series page, needs
  its spec, written with Tophe.

## 2026-10-17 — T101 The series page on v0.13.0, no such series — done
- Did: the backend pins `v0.13.0`; each series of the list answers its
  `id`, the uuid of its `series` row read through
  `CatalogueEditions.findSeriesIds`; `GET /api/v1/series/{id}` answers every
  reader `404` `/problems/not-found` through `FindCatalogueSeries`, `Found`
  answered `200` once T102 produces it.
- Decided: `ListCatalogueSeries` reads the id of a name group from its first
  edition, `seriesIds.getValue(seriesEditions.first().id)`; `ApiContractTest`
  shares one `CatalogueSeries` fixture, `ASTERIX_SERIES`, between the list's
  stub and `Found`'s, beside `ASTERIX` its id. The run handed off after
  step 9 and a second run finished step 10.
- Deviations from the brief: steps 1 to 3 went in one commit, steps 4 and
  8 in one, since each red lasted until its green and a red commit would
  leave `main..HEAD` failing.
- Left over: finding the series and its books, T102; the series page on the
  frontend, T103.
